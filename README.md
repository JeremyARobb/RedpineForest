# RedpineForest

This is a micro managing game, you start off as a former creature (see The Misty Isles if you dont know what a former is) trying to make
a living in RedpineForest, a subsequent land. You start by collecting some materials, and building your first building, which will unlock
three more buildings, one will improve your collecting stat, one will unlock another creature, whom can also go on missions to gather materials
and one will increase food yield (which you need to keep in check else it will impact your final score). After the time limit, 85 days or so
(can be more if you manage to afford a liscense to build a bit longer) you get a score based on an array of stuff, how many creatures you
collected, how many resources you have, the buildings you built, how many food shortages, the raids you won/lost etc.
